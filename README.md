# NFT Hub

Welcome to the NFT Hub! This project showcases a beautifully crafted user interface for a non-functional NFT marketplace, designed using JavaScript, React.js, and Tailwind CSS.

## About
I'm passionate about creating engaging and visually appealing user interfaces. The NFT Hub is a result of my dedication to honing my skills in JavaScript, React.js, and Tailwind CSS. Although it currently focuses on the UI with no functionality, it serves as a canvas for the incredible stories behind each NFT that I aim to bring to life in the future.

## Features
- Beautifully crafted UI
- Responsive design for all devices
- Placeholder for NFT stories
